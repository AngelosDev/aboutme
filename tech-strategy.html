          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>System Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform is a multi-tenant SaaS solution designed to operate across multiple cloud providers, including
          AWS, GCP, and Azure. The system architecture is divided into several key components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend and Backend Services:</strong> Built using Javascript, Python, Express, FastAPI, Apollo
            GraphQL, and React.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Management:</strong> Utilizes PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and BigQuery for data storage and
            management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Hosted primarily on AWS, with GCP used for specific data engineering
            tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pipeline Orchestration:</strong> Managed by Apache Airflow, allowing for efficient and scalable data
            pipeline management.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The architecture supports horizontal scaling, ensuring that compute resources can grow with the increasing
          demands of our tenants. Tenant isolation is implemented at both the data and compute levels, ensuring that
          customer data remains secure and performance remains consistent across the platform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="multi-tenancy">
        <h2>Platform Multi-Tenancy</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform supports a multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), multi-tenant SaaS model. Each tenant's data is
          isolated, ensuring that customers can operate independently without affecting others. The platform can support
          regional isolation under an Enterprise License, allowing customers to host their data in specific
          AWS-supported regions (e.g., AWS US or AWS EU regions). However, customers cannot specify which cloud provider
          we use. For scenarios requiring strict compliance or additional isolation, we engage in separate discussions
          with the customer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scalability">
        <h2>Scalability and Tenant Isolation</h2>
        <p>
          As the business scales, the platform is designed to handle increased workloads by providing horizontal scaling
          capabilities such as database sharding, load balancing, and state management solutions. Tenant isolation is a
          critical aspect of the architecture, ensuring that the data and workloads of one tenant do not affect others.
          For example, a complex query by one tenant should not impact the performance of other tenants on the platform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="cost">
        <h2>Cost Management Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          The platform is designed to keep per-tenant costs to a minimum, ensuring that the number of tenants grows
          faster than the associated costs. This non-linear cost growth is achieved through efficient resource
          allocation, shared infrastructure, and economies of scale. Customizations are handled via configuration and
          feature flagging, avoiding the need for separate deployments for each tenant, further reducing complexity and
          costs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="customization">
        <h2>Customization and Deployment Complexity</h2>
        <p>
          All features are available to every tenant, with customizations handled through configuration and feature
          flags. This approach ensures that we do not deploy different versions of the platform for different tenants,
          reducing operational complexity and deployment costs. Features are bundled by product marketing, with the
          ability to change terminology without affecting the underlying software architecture.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="operational">
        <h2>Operational Complexity and Service Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          We adhere to a "you build it, you run it" philosophy, where each service is owned by the team responsible for
          its development, operation, and maintenance. Each service must self-document its owners and supporting
          resources in a declarative way, enabling the construction of a service catalog for easy discovery and
          integration. A centralized platform team supports service teams with disaster recovery, database schema
          management, and database point-in-time recovery, ensuring operational continuity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data-mesh">
        <h2>Data Mesh Architecture Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform follows a decentralized data mesh architecture, empowering business domains to control their
          data, security, and compliance. Data access is primarily programmatic via APIs, as well as utilizing data
          streams and event-driven triggers. Each data product registers itself with a centralized data catalog for easy
          discoverability. While centralized data pipelines may be necessary at times, they are only used when a domain
          requires centralized data for purposes such as auditing or analysis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="software">
        <h2>Software Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Teams have some freedom to experiment with programming languages suitable for their solutions, but we favor
          tech stacks that support hiring, training, and problem-solving efficiency. Our core languages include
          Javascript for both frontend and backend, and Python for backend data services. We utilize frameworks such as
          Express, FastAPI, Apollo GraphQL, and React. AWS is our primary cloud provider for application and service
          hosting, while GCP is used for BigQuery and data engineering. Our database solutions include PostgreSQL,
          DynamoDB, Redis, and BigQuery, with Apache Airflow used for pipeline orchestration.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="governance">
        <h2>Data Governance and Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure that our platform adheres to legal and organizational requirements, we implement strict data
          governance and compliance measures:

            <strong>Data Quality:</strong> We enforce data quality standards across all domains, with continuous
            monitoring and validation to prevent data corruption or loss.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Lifecycle Management:</strong> We implement policies for data retention, archival, and
            deletion, ensuring that data is managed according to customer and regulatory requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
