        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a technology leader with a proven track record of driving innovation and growth across SaaS data
          platforms, retail, and marketplaces. I've led teams of up to 100 engineers in startups, scaleups, and
          enterprise environments, delivering B2B projects with revenues ranging from £200k to £1.5M ARR.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my most recent role at Baresquare, I led the development of a Seed-funded AI/ML insights SaaS. I joined the
          founding team, re-architected their solution, and overhauled the team and processes to deliver the product in
          a lean and nimble way, without any attrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier in my career, as CTO UK at Maru Group, I spearheaded the development of new capabilities, platform
          migrations, and acquisitions, generating over $35M in annual revenue. I've also delivered impactful tech
          solutions and improved team operations at Sainsbury's and Checkatrade.
