            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a technology leader with a proven track record of driving innovation and growth across SaaS data platforms, retail, and marketplaces. 
                I've led teams of up to 100 engineers in startups, scaleups, and enterprise environments, delivering B2B projects with revenues ranging 
                from £200k to £1.5M ARR.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my most recent role at Baresquare, I led the development of a Seed-funded AI/ML insights SaaS. I joined the founding team, 
                re-architected their solution, and overhauled the team and processes to deliver the product in a lean and nimble way, without any attrition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier in my career, as CTO UK at Maru Group, I spearheaded the development of new capabilities, platform migrations, and acquisitions, 
                generating over $35M in annual revenue. I've also delivered impactful tech solutions and improved team operations at Sainsbury's and Checkatrade.
