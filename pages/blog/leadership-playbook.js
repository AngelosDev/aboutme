            <h2>Forming a Plan</h2>
            <p>
              In my career, I've led diverse teams across various sizes, disciplines, and organizations. My leadership
              style is flexible, adaptive, and deeply rooted in trust and collaboration. Below is a generic plan for the
              first 120 days within a new organization, structured to align with the needs of the business, a
              high-performing engineering function and its people.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="30-days" className={styles.section}>

            <h3>People</h3>
            <h4>Connection & Trust:</h4>
            <p>
              I begin by getting to know my team members, both professionally and personally, sharing my own journey to
              create a foundation of trust and authenticity. I don't hesitate to show vulnerability by sharing my own
              strengths and weaknesses. This fosters an environment of openness and mutual respect.
            </p>

            <h4>Understanding Ambitions:</h4>
            <p>
              Through 1:1 conversations, I uncover each team member's ambitions and motivations, and how their current
              roles align with those goals. This helps me identify opportunities for growth and ensure their efforts
              contribute to the team's and company's success.
            </p>

            <h4>Feedback & Actionable Goals:</h4>
            <p>
              I ask team members to share 2–3 things they would like to see improved, started, or stopped. From this, I
              collaborate with them to set actionable, short-term goals that are achievable within the first 90 days,
              helping them build momentum and confidence.
            </p>

            <h3>Product/Service</h3>
            <h4>Business Core Understanding:</h4>
            <p>
              I immerse myself in understanding the product or service at the heart of the business—what drives revenue,
              what opportunities exist, and where the pain points lie.
            </p>

            <h4>Process Review:</h4>
            <p>
              I evaluate key processes, such as how customer feedback is collected, how issues are resolved, and how
              SLAs and KPIs are managed.
            </p>

            <p>
              I assess software delivery cycles, quality standards, and how updates are perceived by end users. This
              provides a baseline to prioritize improvements in reliability and user satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h3>Business Structure & Communication</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> I attend cross-functional meetings to grasp the pulse
                of the organization, map stakeholders, and understand team structures and leadership dynamics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> I create a stakeholder map to ensure I know who to engage with
                and when, enabling effective communication and alignment across departments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Communication Practices:</strong> I review how the business communicates, collaborates, and
                documents decisions, identifying gaps and opportunities for smoother workflows.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technology</h3>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk Identification:</strong> I evaluate existing risk management processes, prioritization of
                distinct risks and how they feed into the roadmap and budget.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Growth Plan</h3>
            <p>
              I evaluate the growth trajectory, whether it's organic, sales-driven, or product-led, ensuring the team is
              structured and resourced to meet future opportunities and challenges. This includes assessing the team's
              current capacity, skill set, and potential for growth.
            </p>

            <h3>Hand-over Plan</h3>
            <p>
              I meet with stakeholders to discuss the hand-over plan, ensuring a smooth transition of responsibilities
              from them to me. This includes identifying key hand-over documents, setup of knowledge transfer sessions,
              and any additional support needed with a target date for completion. This is key for ensuring that
              existing members of the team feel supported and that the team is able to continue to function effectively
              during the transition.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Inward-Facing: Team Performance and Operational Efficiency</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Release Cadence:</strong> Track the frequency and size of deployments to maintain a consistent,
                predictable flow of value delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cycle Time:</strong> Measure the time from idea to production to identify and eliminate
                bottlenecks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Incident Rate and Recovery Time:</strong> Monitor the frequency of production issues and how
                quickly they are resolved to ensure operational resilience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lead Time for Changes:</strong> Assess the time it takes for code to move from development to
                production, ensuring the pipeline is optimized and not overburdened.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              By consistently evaluating these metrics, I ensure that teams not only deliver value but also operate in a
              sustainable, efficient manner that aligns with business and customer expectations.
