              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                The Airport Transfer Notifier is a real-time flight monitoring system that I designed and built to
                address a common challenge in the travel industry: managing airport transfers efficiently when flights
                are delayed or rescheduled. This system automates the process of monitoring flight status changes,
                notifying transportation providers of these changes, and updating customer records in a CRM system.

              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>
                Airport transfer companies face significant operational challenges when flights are delayed,
                rescheduled, or canceled. These challenges include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Manually monitoring hundreds of flights daily across multiple airports</li>
                <li>Rapidly communicating flight changes to drivers who may already be en route to the airport</li>
                <li>Updating customer service teams and internal systems with revised pickup times</li>
                <li>Ensuring availability of vehicles and drivers when flights arrive at new times</li>
                <li>Maintaining quality of service despite unpredictable changes to flight schedules</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The process typically involves staff manually checking flight status websites, making phone calls to
                dispatch, and updating various systemsâ€”a labor-intensive and error-prone approach that can result in
                missed pickups, unnecessary driver wait times, and poor customer experience.
              </p>

            <section id="solution" className={styles.section}>
              <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
              <p>The Airport Transfer Notifier automates this entire process through a robust system that:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Continuously monitors flight status through integration with multiple airline data providers</li>
                <li>Detects changes in arrival times, gates, terminals, or flight status (delays, cancellations)</li>
                <li>Calculates the impact on scheduled airport transfers</li>
                <li>
                  Notifies relevant stakeholders (drivers, dispatchers, customers) via their preferred communication
                  channels
                </li>
                <li>Updates internal systems (CRM, dispatch software) with the new information</li>
                <li>Provides a centralized dashboard for operations teams to manage exceptions</li>
              </ol>

            <section id="implementation" className={styles.section}>
              <h2>Implementation Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                Developing the Airport Transfer Notifier involved overcoming several significant technical and
                operational challenges:
              </p>

              <h3>Data Reliability and Consistency</h3>
              <p>
                Flight information often varies between data sources, with different update frequencies and formats. To
                address this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Implemented a source reliability scoring system that weights data based on historical accuracy</li>
                <li>
                  Created a data normalization layer to transform varied formats into a consistent internal
                  representation
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed conflict resolution algorithms to handle contradictory information from different sources
                </li>
                <li>Established fallback data sources for when primary APIs experience downtime</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Network Reliability</h3>
              <p>
                Drivers often operate in areas with poor connectivity, particularly in remote airport parking areas:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed the mobile app with offline capabilities and data synchronization when connectivity is
                  restored
                </li>
                <li>Implemented message delivery confirmation and retry mechanisms</li>
                <li>Used SMS as a fallback communication method when push notifications couldn't be delivered</li>
                <li>Cached essential trip data locally on driver devices to ensure operation without connectivity</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Scaling for Peak Periods</h3>
              <p>Air travel has distinct peak periods (holidays, weekends) with significantly higher volume:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Implemented AWS auto-scaling groups to dynamically adjust server capacity based on current load</li>
                <li>Designed database sharding strategies to maintain performance during high-volume periods</li>
                <li>
                  Created prioritization systems to ensure critical notifications are processed first during peak times
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed load testing scenarios that simulated holiday travel patterns to verify system resilience
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Integration with Legacy Systems</h3>
              <p>Many transportation companies use older dispatch and CRM systems with limited API capabilities:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Built a flexible integration layer with adapters for various legacy systems</li>
                <li>Created data transformation modules to handle different data models and formats</li>
                <li>
                  Implemented validation and error handling specific to each target system's quirks and limitations
                </li>
                <li>Developed a secure file-based integration option for systems without API support</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

              <p>
                The Airport Transfer Notifier demonstrates how targeted technology solutions can transform traditionally
                reactive operational processes into proactive, efficient systems. By automating the monitoring and
                communication processes around flight changes, the system has significantly improved resource
                utilization, customer satisfaction, and business performance for airport transfer operators.

                This project showcases the power of integrating disparate data sources, implementing smart notification
                systems, and creating purpose-built mobile applications to solve specific industry challenges.
