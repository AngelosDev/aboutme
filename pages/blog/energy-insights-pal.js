              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                Energy Insights PAL is an advanced smart meter monitoring system I designed and built, incorporating
                alerting and forecasting capabilities. It processes millions of meter readings daily, detecting
                abnormalities, predicting consumption patterns, and providing actionable insights to both business users
                and consumers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system serves as a "Personal Assistant for Living" (PAL), helping users understand their energy
                consumption patterns and providing proactive recommendations for energy optimization.
